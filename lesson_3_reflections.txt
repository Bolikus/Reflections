-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I want to use remote repository when I work on some project with another guys, as well I want to backup my data too =)
This row I add by the web interface from github.com

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes I can work at the sime file and don't want resolve any conflicts. Also sometimes I don't want to waste my 3g connections. Manually updating is more controllable.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a github only feature - you cope someone else repository to your new repository. Your new repository links to the parent repository. Clone is a cope remote repository to your local machine. Branches is a new branch in commit tree in the repository.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can always roll out your changes to the initial state. Also you can harmlessly merge your changes with remote.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

After this course I have known only one colloboration tool - Google Docs. But for code projcet GITHUB is more convenient.
