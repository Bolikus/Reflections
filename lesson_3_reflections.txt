-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I want to use remote repository when I work on some project with another guys, as well I want to backup my data too =)
This row I add by the web interface from github.com

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes I can work at the sime file and don't want resolve any conflicts. Also sometimes I don't want to waste my 3g connections. Manually updating is more controllable.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a github only feature - you cope someone else repository to your new repository. Your new repository links to the parent repository. Clone is a cope remote repository to your local machine. Branches is a new branch in commit tree in the repository.
